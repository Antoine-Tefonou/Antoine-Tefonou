# Hi there 👋, I'm Antoine !

## 🚀 About Me
I am currently a Leeds Beckett University' student, from my youngest age I always endeavour to use logic to solve problems, so growing up this way I started falling deeper and deeper in love with everything related to numbers and from half secondary school I was oriented in science's subjects where solving complex problems need breaking them into parts in order to get an efficient and prompt solution. This is of course what drew me to love Computer Science. starting programming allowed me to develop further all my fundamentals knowledge on software and hardware I already acquired from computer system, data base and algorithmic. This will help me to understand more efficient in software program and surely lots of computer's concepts.
